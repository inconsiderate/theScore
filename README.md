# theScore

Working (development) application can be found at [thescore.meteor.com](thescore.meteor.com)

>A mobile-first (and mobile only) app designed to keep track of player scores in our lunch-time office board games. It's designed for mobile, so it's going to look really weird on your computer unless you make your window really long and narrow. ;)

Built with Meteor and Semantic UI.
